I want an `install` script that configures a bunch of stuff.
It should be based on components / packages. So I specify
which packages I want to install, and each package installs a collection
of components.

Files should live in the dotfiles directory and be symlinked to the
places they need to be.  Secrets should live in $HOME/secrets and be installed
similarly. (This can be populated from an existing instance, or a USB
key).

Bash config
  1. Handles linux and (X) Mac
  X. Handles bash aliases

Git (NB: It's not useful to store a script to install git on github)
  X. Installs git config
  2. Git completion?

Tmux
  X. Installs if not present ( brew / apt-get )
  X. tmux conf

Vim
  1. Vimrc
  2. Plugin install

Terminals
  1. Basic.terminal on Mac
  2. Similar on Linux

Ssh

X: ag

X: fzf

X: tree

tig

Conda (This is heavy and should be optional)
Jupyter / iPython / matplotlib / conda
Docker / gcloud / k8s / aws (?)
Npm / Nvm
Password manager (?)
